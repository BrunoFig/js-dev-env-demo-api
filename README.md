# JavaScript Development Environment (API)

This is a API for the generic JavaScript Development Environment from ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment" on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents) by [Cory House](https://github.com/coryhouse), that **isn't tied** to any specific JavaScript framework. In case of doubts refer to [Cory's GitHub repository](https://github.com/coryhouse/javascript-development-environment)
